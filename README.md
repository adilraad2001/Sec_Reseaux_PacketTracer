 1. **Introduction:**
    In this report, we will discuss the practical exercises or TP that we completed using Packet Tracer, a network simulation tool. The objective of this TP was to gain practical experience in tracing a network and configuring an access list. We learned how to use the Packet Tracer interface to design, configure, and troubleshoot virtual networks, and how to configure access lists to control network traffic. The skills we acquired in this TP are essential for many careers in IT and networking, and this report will highlight our experience and the lessons we learned. 
    
    1. *Objectifs de ce TP :*
